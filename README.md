# PokeStore-Direct
A mock website created for the ReactJS portion of the Odin Project website. 

This project will showcase my ability to create a  multi-page application using ReactJs and to access data using an API.

I will be using the PokeAPI to access the database of items I want to sell on my products page. 

These prooducts will then be put in an order that the user can change via a button on the side e.g "alphabetical" "Price".
The user will have the ability to add a product to their shopping basket.

I am unsure yet, but I was hoping to create a seperate component for the shopping basket, showing each item the user wants to purchase, 
and their ability to increase or decrease the quantity of each item, or delete items that they no longer want. 
The shopping basket will also show the total price. 

Other features I hope the website will have is a sticky bar at the top showing which page you are on and the number of items in the shopping basket.
