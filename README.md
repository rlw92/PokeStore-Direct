# PokeStore-Direct

Created for the React Javascript portion of the Odin Project.
Website built using ReactJS and the PokeAPI.
Live Demo ---> https://rlw92.github.io/PokeStore-Direct/


**19.11.22 Planned Updates**

This is one of the projects I plan on using for my portfolio so I will be implementing some
updates to polish it up:

Homepage:
1. On the homepage the building image scrolls over in mobile view.
2. Add some nice background color or styling to the homepage text portion
3. On the navbar the homepage button lights up when on hover without a cursor

Products page:
4. In mobile the product boxes squish together, implement grid design
5. Same issue as 3 above. Fix navbar basically.

Checkout:
6. When user clicks checkout I want there to be a form for them to fill in
location details along with a rundown of their Products
7. Once a user has entered this info then we should get an animation
of the pokemon blue/red era bicycle travelling.
8. The user will then have the option to press a button and return to the homepage.

**Starting Notes:**

This project will showcase my ability to create a  multi-page application using ReactJs and to access data using an API.

I will be using the PokeAPI to access the database of items I want to sell on my products page.

These prooducts will then be put in an order that the user can change via a button on the side e.g "alphabetical" "Price".
The user will have the ability to add a product to their shopping basket.

I am unsure yet, but I was hoping to create a seperate component for the shopping basket, showing each item the user wants to purchase,
and their ability to increase or decrease the quantity of each item, or delete items that they no longer want.
The shopping basket will also show the total price.

Other features I hope the website will have is a sticky bar at the top showing which page you are on and the number of items in the shopping basket.



**PROJECT FINISHED NOTES**

So looking at my original plans for this project above i can confidently say that the only feature that I was unable to implement was the a number showing which page the user is on, instead going for a single page that loads six items
at a time and I am happy with this.

The other features have been successfully implemented and I would be confident going into another project using an API with react.

I do hope to return to this project and clean it up a little. I have an idea for a checkout modal that shows the order list and a form for the user to enter their location which will when submitted will show an animation or gif of a cyclist from the old games cycling to their location. SO I hope I will return to this after my css skills are honed and sharpened.
